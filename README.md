# South France Holidays

## Introduction

South France Holidays is a property made up of the main house with three villas connected. The property is available to rent for amazing prices and is situated only ten minutes from the beautiful medieval city of Carcassone.

The overall aim of my project is the make an appealing website to showcase this stunning property.

# 1. User Experience (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  I wanted to the user to be able to navigate through the website easily without over burdening them with too much information. Three pages which include Home, Gallery and Contact Us which are all easily navigated. When researching other holiday websites I found there was too much going on. I opted to keep it simple for the user with presenting the right information.

The website content provides information about about what we offer in this holiday home. We present the information via an about section on Home page as well as a Gallery so potential customers can see where they will stay.
* The site structure is designed considering the expectation of users to be simple and easy to use.
* The user interface is easy to navigate with three links in navbar
* Responsive design for all screen/device sizes like mobile, tablet and desktop.
* a link form provided for those users who will be interested to staying at the property.

## 1.3 Color Scheme
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Initially I opted to use #6F9CEB as the whole background. After some discussion with mentor we decided a white background would look better with some blue in the header as well in the about section. As for the font I liked the color #ffbe0b. I think it bounces off the other colors well and symbolises the color of the sun. 

Other foreground and background color used in the sites are
* foreground: #6F9CEB
* background: #white
* font: #ffbe0b

## 1.5 Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.

# 2. Features

 ### All 3 pages:
- Navigation bar is placed at the top right corner of the page, and considered a hover effect that underlines when we want to click the page as well as active page being underlined. The hover effect is placed to improve the user expereince.
- Site title is located top left of screen. Clicking this will return user to home screen
- Background color of nav bar and foreground color were chosen considering the contrast between background and foreground colours.
- Social media links (for facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram) are placed at the bottom of the each page in the footer. All the links will open in a new tab. I added a hover effect to each link for style.
